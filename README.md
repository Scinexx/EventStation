## EventStation Github
This is a direct fork of TG but with Anorexia Station (Slimmed down box station)

## Station Rules
(This is a copypaste from the server owner)
Event station is a server that is currently run every saturday at 2 Pm pacific coast time. 
The uniqueness of event station comes from the fact that it relies on the creativity of the admins, 
this is because no normal round will ever be played on event station, every single round played
(which for the time being will be only one round a week) will be an event.
each event will have time to set up with the players either waiting in the lobby or in the arrivals ship,
it should take only take ten or so minutes to set up the event but in a case where a large amount of set up is needed a thunderdome may be set up.
players will allowed to join in for only a certain amount of time, usually the ten minutes of set up. 
after this all connections will be shut down and no other players will be allowed to join. this is to help with people trying to mutlikey or spam
rules on the server will be incredibly lax, with rules being 
1. spamming or crashing is an instant ban
2. you can speak anything you wish but no porn or generaly degenerate images.
- OOC chat will be disabled durring the round and no links will allowed in IC chat.(this isnt bannable but will probably just get your dick blown off)
3. at the beginning of every event an admin will put in what rules to follow, however, if broken these rules will never result in a ban, only a gib/bluespace.(edited)
rp is allowed at any amount you wish, but erp will be screenshotted and kept in the cum shed.
if we see you being an ultra faggot and spreading rumors online we won't ban you. unless if its actually serious shit then maybe but even then I don't really care.
to talk more about rule three, every single event will have its own rules specified at the beginning of the round by an admin anouncement or similar.
these rules will be lax by themselves but if broken will lead to a gibbing. this means if you just fuck up you can play the next week
an example would be if a round had an admin say two rules,
1. do not use bombs/atmos/chem/ or viro to kill the entire station.
2. do not use sharp objects or guns, only blunt objects.
B. try to act and dress like a wrestler.
in this senerio it would pretty much be a wrestle mania, and all players would have to use their fists, or anything that wasnt a blade or sharp.
however, the B rule would just be an extra rule that doesn't need to be followed, but would make it a lot more fun.
but since these are one time rules, they would only result in the player being gibbed or having both their arms being blown off.
a player could never be banned for breaking rules that were only added for one round.
however, if an accidental gibbing occurs the player can either be revieved or given the chance to be special role the next week.
but if baiting of this occurs and is noticed the player will be a poopy loser, but nothing else would happen.
finding loop holes is fine but will probably have the hole be fixed.
other then that the current round may be streamed by anyone who wishes to stream that day as an ai.
this is because some dumn lore or something that the station is actual a game show and the host is the ai.
beacause of this the ai would be allowed to do small things but is not allowed to directly smash a person to death with an airlock.
basically if the ai does something that makes the show funner to watch, its allowed.
if a stream is on the streamer can follow anyone they wish, 
and cameras should be indestructible.
however for now, most cameras will be able to be cut. this should be fixed in a small amount of time.

thats about it. Event station is a server like no other and should hold some of the funnest rounds for most people.
or not who knows
